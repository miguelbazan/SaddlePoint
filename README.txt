Problem Description

The saddle point in a square matriz, is a cell that is the greatest in the row and at the same time the smallest in the column, or the smallest in the row and the greatest of the column. A square matriz NO always has a saddle point.

For a 3 x 3 matriz with the next integers:

1 4 2
9 8 1
3 7 6

The saddle point is the position [0][1], because the 4 is the greatest of the row 0 and the smallest of the column 1.


Input

The first line is the dimention of the matriz (1 <= n <= 10), after this comes the n x n integers of the matix.

Output

In one line print the row and the column of the saddle point, if the matrix does not have, print -1 -1. Print a blank between the row and the column.
Sample Input

3
1 4 2
9 8 1
3 7 6

Sample Output

0 1
